## üöÄ Setup & Verification

### Check if Tables Exist
```sql
SELECT 
  table_name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('voices', 'saved_phrases', 'shared_access', 'voice_usage_logs')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### Check Indexes
```sql
SELECT tablename, indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('voices', 'saved_phrases', 'shared_access', 'voice_usage_logs')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

### Check RLS Status
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('voices', 'saved_phrases', 'shared_access', 'voice_usage_logs');
```

### Verify Database Setup
```sql
-- Should return 4 tables
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('voices', 'saved_phrases', 'shared_access', 'voice_usage_logs');
```

## üéØ Quick Actions

### Complete Voice Deletion (all related data)

-- This will cascade delete phrases, shares, and logs
DELETE FROM voices WHERE id = 'voice-uuid';
```

### Clone Voice Metadata (not audio)

INSERT INTO voices (
  user_id,
  voice_id,
  name,
  description,
  quality_score
)
SELECT 
  user_id,

WHERE usage_count > 100 
  AND is_active = true;
```

### Export Voice List (JSON)
```sql
SELECT json_agg(
  json_build_object(
    'id', id,
    'name', name,
    'voice_id', voice_id,
    'created_at', created_at,
    'usage_count', usage_count
  )
)
FROM voices
WHERE is_active = true;
```

## üìù Notes

- All queries use `is_active = true` to exclude soft-deleted records
- Replace `'voice-uuid'`, `'user-uuid'`, etc. with actual UUIDs
- Use transactions for important updates
- Always backup before running DELETE or UPDATE on production
- Add `LIMIT` clauses for large tables
- Indexes are optimized for these common queries

---

## üÜò Emergency Queries

### Restore All Deleted Voices (use with caution!)
```sql
UPDATE voices 
SET is_active = true 
WHERE is_active = false 
  AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### Find All Data for a Specific Voice
```sql
-- Voice
SELECT * FROM voices WHERE id = 'voice-uuid';

-- Phrases
SELECT * FROM saved_phrases WHERE voice_id = 'voice-uuid';

-- Shares
SELECT * FROM shared_access WHERE voice_id = 'voice-uuid';

-- Usage logs
SELECT * FROM voice_usage_logs WHERE voice_id = 'voice-uuid' LIMIT 100;
```
