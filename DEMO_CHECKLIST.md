## 🎤 90-Second Demo Script

### Opening Hook (10 seconds)
> "What would you say to your family if you knew you were losing your voice forever?"

[Pause 2 seconds]

### Problem Statement (15 seconds)
> "30,000 Americans this year will lose their voice to ALS, cancer, or stroke. Current voice banking costs $3,000 and takes months. Most people miss the window."

### Solution Demo (40 seconds)
> "Meet VoiceBank."

**[SHOW]**
1. Landing page → Click "Start Recording"
2. Recording interface → Fast-forward through 1-2 prompts
3. Generation progress bar → Skip ahead to completion
4. Dashboard → Type "I love you" → Click Speak
5. **PLAY AUDIO** in cloned voice

> "15 minutes. Free. Forever."

### Emotional Impact (15 seconds)
> "This is my [family member's] voice. They recorded this before [event]. Voice banking should be as common as writing a will. We're making that possible."

### Closing (10 seconds)
> "VoiceBank preserves what makes us human — our voice, our identity, our connection. Thank you."

**[End with tagline on screen]**: "Preserve your voice. Forever. 🎙️"

## ❓ Anticipated Judge Questions

### "How good is the voice quality?"
> "It's 90% as good as $3,000 professional solutions. For the use case—staying connected with family—it's more than enough. Listen for yourself." [Play demo]

### "What about deepfakes/misuse?"
> "Great question. We have clear consent during recording, voice models are private by default, and we're exploring audio watermarking. This is for personal medical use, not impersonation."

### "How do you make money?"
> "For the hackathon, our focus is impact. Post-hackathon: partnerships with hospitals/ALS organizations, premium features for families, potential grant funding from NIH/ALS Association."

### "What if someone's voice has already changed?"
> "Ideally people record while healthy—like writing a will. For those mid-diagnosis, we capture what remains. Even partial preservation is meaningful."

### "Why not use existing TTS?"
> "Generic robot voices lack personality and emotional connection. Your voice is part of your identity. Families want to hear *their* loved one, not a computer."

### "How long does voice generation take?"
> "5-10 minutes of processing. We show progress updates, and users can grab coffee. Once created, text-to-speech is instant."

### "What's the technical challenge?"
> "Audio quality varies (home microphones, background noise). We preprocess audio, guide users with real-time feedback, and allow re-recording prompts. The UX is the hard part—making it simple for non-technical users."
