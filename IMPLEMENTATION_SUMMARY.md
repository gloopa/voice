## üîß Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### GET /api/voices
```typescript
// Get all voices (or filter by userId)
const response = await fetch('/api/voices?userId=optional')
// Returns: { voices: Voice[] }
```

#### PATCH /api/voices
```typescript
// Update voice name or active status
await fetch('/api/voices', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  body: JSON.stringify({ id, name })
})
```

#### DELETE /api/voices
```typescript
// Soft delete a voice
await fetch('/api/voices?id=uuid', {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
```

### Component Props

#### VoiceSelector
```typescript
interface VoiceSelectorProps {
  voices: Voice[]
  selectedVoice: Voice | null
  onSelectVoice: (voice: Voice) => void
  className?: string
}
```

---

## üìù Database Migration Required

### Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
The schema is already in your `database.sql` file, but make sure it's been executed:

```sql
-- Check if voices table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_name = 'voices'
);

-- If false, run the full database.sql file
```

### Verify Setup:
```sql
-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'voices';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'voices';
```

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Authentication** - All voices visible to everyone
2. **No Audio Storage** - Original recordings not uploaded
3. **No Voice Samples** - Can't preview voices
4. **No Sharing** - Can't share voices with others

### Workarounds
1. Authentication will be added in next phase
2. Audio storage is commented in code, ready to implement
3. Voice samples can be pre-generated and stored
4. Sharing feature exists in database schema

## üîÆ Next Steps / Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Recommended Next)
1. **Add Supabase Authentication**
   - User signup/login
   - Filter voices by user_id
   - Enable RLS policies

2. **Upload Original Recordings**
   - Save to Supabase Storage
   - Associate with voice records
   - Enable voice re-training

3. **Voice Samples**
   - Pre-generate sample phrase
   - Show in Voice Library
   - Play button for preview

### Phase 3 (Advanced)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Voice not saving to database
**Symptoms**: Voice works but doesn't appear in Voice Library

**Solutions**:
1. Check Supabase connection in console
2. Verify `database.sql` was executed
3. Check `/api/generate-voice` response
4. Look for errors in console

**Debug Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM voices ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Voice selector not showing
**Symptoms**: Dropdown doesn't appear in dashboard

**Solutions**:
1. Check if voices array is empty
2. Verify `loadVoices()` is being called
3. Check `loadingVoices` state
4. Look for component errors

### Can't switch voices
**Symptoms**: Selecting voice doesn't change

**Solutions**:
1. Clear sessionStorage
2. Check `handleVoiceSelect` function
3. Verify voice_id is valid ElevenLabs ID
4. Check console for API errors
