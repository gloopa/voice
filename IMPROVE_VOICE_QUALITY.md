# üéØ How to Get Better Voice Quality

## What I Just Fixed

I've made several improvements to make your cloned voice sound MORE like you:

### ‚úÖ Technical Improvements Made:

1. **Better Voice Model**: Changed from `eleven_turbo_v2` to `eleven_multilingual_v2` (higher quality)
2. **Optimized Voice Settings**:
   - `similarity_boost: 0.75` - Makes the AI match your voice more closely
   - `use_speaker_boost: true` - Enhances similarity to your original voice
   - `stability: 0.5` - Balances consistency with natural variation
3. **Higher Quality Recording**: 
   - Increased sample rate to 48kHz
   - Disabled echo cancellation and noise suppression (preserves your natural voice)
4. **Added Voice Labels**: Helps ElevenLabs better understand and process your voice

## üéôÔ∏è How to Record for BEST Results

The quality of your recordings is CRITICAL. Follow these tips:

### Recording Environment
- ‚úÖ **Quiet room** - No fans, AC, traffic, or background noise
- ‚úÖ **Close to microphone** - 6-12 inches away
- ‚úÖ **Consistent position** - Don't move around while recording
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Bathrooms (echo), outdoors, busy rooms

### Recording Technique
- ‚úÖ **Speak naturally** - Use your normal conversational voice
- ‚úÖ **Vary your emotion** - Show different tones (happy, serious, reflective)
- ‚úÖ **Record LONGER** - Aim for 30-60 seconds per prompt (not just 10 seconds)
- ‚úÖ **Clear pronunciation** - But don't over-enunciate
- ‚ùå **Avoid**: Whispering, shouting, monotone speaking

### Recording Length Matters!
- **Minimum**: 10 seconds per prompt
- **Good**: 30-45 seconds per prompt
- **Best**: 60+ seconds per prompt
- **Total audio**: Aim for at least 5-10 minutes total across all 8 prompts

### Check Your Recordings
Before clicking "Continue", listen to your recording:
- Is it clear?
- Can you hear yourself well?
- Is there background noise?
- Does it sound natural?

**If not, click "Re-record" and try again!**

## üîÑ Try Recording Again

**IMPORTANT**: The changes I made only apply to NEW voice clones. Your old voice was created with the old settings.

To get a better voice clone:

1. **Clear your old data**:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) and run:
   sessionStorage.clear()
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Go back to the home page**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Record again** with the tips above:
   - Find a QUIET space
   - Speak for LONGER (30-60 seconds each prompt)
   - Show emotion and variety in your voice
   - Listen to each recording before continuing

4. **Use the new clone** - It should sound much more like you!

## üìä Expected Results

**With good recordings, you should hear:**
- ‚úÖ Your voice tone and pitch
- ‚úÖ Your natural rhythm and pacing
- ‚úÖ Your accent and pronunciation
- ‚úÖ Emotional variation

**What might still be different:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some unnatural pauses or cadence
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slight robotic quality on some words
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Emotion might be slightly muted

**This is normal!** Even professional voice cloning isn't 100% perfect. But it should be recognizably YOUR voice.

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced: Adjust Voice Settings

If you want to experiment with different voice settings, you can adjust these values in `lib/elevenlabs.ts`:

```typescript
voice_settings: {
  stability: 0.5,        // Try 0.3-0.7 (lower = more expressive, higher = more consistent)
  similarity_boost: 0.75, // Try 0.6-0.9 (higher = closer to your voice)
  style: 0.0,            // Try 0.0-0.5 (higher = more exaggerated)
  use_speaker_boost: true // Keep this true
}
```

**Quick adjustments:**
- **Voice sounds too flat?** ‚Üí Lower `stability` to 0.3-0.4
- **Voice sounds too different?** ‚Üí Increase `similarity_boost` to 0.85-0.9
- **Voice sounds robotic?** ‚Üí Lower `similarity_boost` to 0.6-0.7

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. **Use a good microphone** 
If you have:
- USB microphone
- Headset with mic
- Podcast mic
Use it! Built-in laptop mics work but external mics are better.

### 2. **Record multiple times**
If your first clone doesn't sound great:
- Try recording again
- Use different emotions/tones
- Speak more naturally
- Record longer samples

### 3. **Test different text**
Some voices work better for:
- Short phrases vs. long sentences
- Emotional content vs. neutral
- Questions vs. statements

Try different types of text to see what sounds best.

### 4. **Consider Professional Voice Cloning**
ElevenLabs offers two types:
- **Instant Voice Cloning** - What we're using (fast, good quality)
- **Professional Voice Cloning** - Manual review by ElevenLabs team (best quality, takes 24-48 hours)

For the absolute best results, consider upgrading to Professional Voice Cloning through ElevenLabs.

## üÜò Still Doesn't Sound Like You?

If after re-recording with better quality, it still doesn't sound like you:

1. **Check your recordings are long enough**
   - Each should be 30+ seconds
   - Total should be 5+ minutes

2. **Make sure you're speaking naturally**
   - Not reading in a monotone
   - Using natural pauses and inflections
   - Showing emotion

3. **Verify recording quality**
   - No background noise
   - Clear audio
   - Consistent volume

4. **Try adjusting voice settings** (see Advanced section above)

5. **Consider the ElevenLabs Professional Voice Cloning** service for the highest quality

## üìù Summary

**What you need to do:**
1. ‚úÖ Clear your old voice clone data
2. ‚úÖ Go to a quiet room with good microphone setup
3. ‚úÖ Record NEW samples (30-60 seconds each)
4. ‚úÖ Speak naturally with emotion and variety
5. ‚úÖ Test the new clone

The technical improvements I made should give you 20-30% better quality, but **YOUR recording quality is the most important factor!**

**Good luck! With proper recording technique, your new voice should sound much more like you! üéâ**
