## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Still doesn't sound like me"

1. **Check recording quality:**
   - Listen to your recordings
   - Are they clear? Natural? Long enough?
   - If not, re-record!

2. **Record in a better environment:**
   - Find the quietest room in your house
   - Record late at night when it's silent
   - Use a better microphone

3. **Speak more naturally:**
   - Don't read - speak
   - Show more emotion
   - Vary your pace and tone

4. **Record longer samples:**
   - 60+ seconds per prompt
   - Tell longer stories
   - Read the full passages slowly

### "Sounds robotic"

- Lower `similarity_boost` to 0.85-0.90
- Make sure you spoke with emotion during recording
- Check that you weren't monotone

### "Sounds too different"

- Increase `similarity_boost` to 0.98
- Re-record with better quality audio
- Make sure you used your natural speaking voice
