# ðŸ”§ Voice Cloning Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem
After recording your voice, the text-to-speech feature is using a default female voice (Rachel) instead of your cloned voice.

## Root Cause
The app was silently falling back to a default ElevenLabs voice when voice cloning failed. This has now been fixed to show you the actual error.

## What I Fixed
1. âœ… Removed the silent fallback to Rachel voice
2. âœ… Added detailed error logging to help diagnose the issue
3. âœ… The app will now show you the real error message when voice cloning fails

## Next Steps - Please Try This

### Step 1: Check Your ElevenLabs Account

Voice cloning requires a **paid ElevenLabs subscription**. The free tier only allows you to use pre-made voices.

1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io and log into your account
2. Click on your profile â†’ **"Subscription"**
3. Check if you have one of these plans:
   - **Starter** ($5/month) - Includes Instant Voice Cloning
   - **Creator** ($22/month) - Includes Professional Voice Cloning
   - **Pro** or higher

**If you're on the free tier:**
- Upgrade to at least the Starter plan ($5/month) to enable voice cloning
- Or use the free trial if available

### Step 2: Verify Your API Key

1. Make sure you have a `.env.local` file in your project root
2. It should contain:
```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_your_actual_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

3. Get a fresh API key:
   - Go to https://elevenlabs.io
   - Click your profile â†’ **"API Keys"**
   - Create a new API key or copy your existing one
   - Replace it in `.env.local`

### Step 3: Test Voice Cloning Again

1. Restart your development server:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

2. Clear your browser data:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to **Application** tab â†’ **Storage** â†’ **Clear site data**
   - Or just use incognito/private mode

3. Record your voice again:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click **"Start Recording"**
   - Complete all 8 prompts
   - Try to generate your voice

4. Check the console for errors:
   - Open DevTools (F12) â†’ **Console** tab
   - Look for any red error messages
   - The new detailed logging will tell you exactly what went wrong

### Step 4: What the Errors Mean

**"Voice cloning failed: ... subscription ..."**
- You need to upgrade your ElevenLabs plan
- Voice cloning is not available on the free tier

**"Voice cloning failed: ... unauthorized ..."** or **"invalid API key"**
- Your API key is incorrect or expired
- Create a new API key in ElevenLabs dashboard

**"Voice cloning failed: ... quota exceeded ..."**
- You've used up your character limit
- Wait for your quota to reset or upgrade your plan

**"Total audio is too short"**
- Your recordings are too brief
- Speak for at least 5-10 seconds for each prompt
- Make sure you click "Stop Recording" after speaking

## Alternative Solution (Temporary)

If you can't upgrade right now, you can use one of ElevenLabs' pre-made voices:

1. Browse available voices at: https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library
2. Click on a voice you like and copy its ID
3. In the dashboard, use `sessionStorage` to set a pre-made voice:
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) and run:
   sessionStorage.setItem('voiceId', 'VOICE_ID_HERE')
   ```

## Need More Help?

If you're still having issues after trying these steps:

1. **Check the terminal** where `npm run dev` is running - look for error messages
2. **Check the browser console** (F12) - look for detailed error logs
3. Share the error message and I can help you fix it

## Important Notes

- **Recording Quality**: Make sure you record in a quiet environment with clear audio
- **Recording Length**: Each prompt should be 5-10 seconds minimum
- **Browser**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari for best results
- **Microphone**: Grant microphone permissions when prompted

**The changes I made will now show you exactly what's going wrong instead of silently using a different voice. Try recording again and check the console for error messages!**
