# âœ… Storage Issue - FIXED

## Problem
**"QuotaExceededError: The quota has been exceeded"**

Your recordings were too large for sessionStorage (~5-10MB limit). With 8 high-quality recordings at 48kHz sample rate, the total size was exceeding this limit.

## Solution
Migrated from **sessionStorage** â†’ **IndexedDB**

- **sessionStorage**: 5-10MB limit (too small)
- **IndexedDB**: 50MB+ (varies by browser, much larger)

## What Changed

### 1. Created `/lib/indexeddb.ts`
- Helper functions for storing large binary data
- `saveRecordings()` - Store recordings
- `getRecordings()` - Retrieve recordings  
- `clearRecordings()` - Clean up

### 2. Updated `/app/record/page.tsx`
- Now uses `saveRecordings()` to store in IndexedDB
- Removed sessionStorage.setItem()
- Added file size logging

### 3. Updated `/app/generate/page.tsx`
- Now uses `getRecordings()` to fetch from IndexedDB
- Converts blobs to data URLs for API

## Benefits

âœ… Can handle much larger recordings
âœ… No more quota errors
âœ… Better for binary data (audio files)
âœ… Persists across browser sessions
âœ… Can store hundreds of MB

## How to Clear Data

If you need to clear old recordings:

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
import { clearRecordings } from '@/lib/indexeddb'
await clearRecordings()

// Or clear everything:
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('VoiceBankDB')
```

**The issue is now fixed! Your recordings will save properly.** ðŸŽ‰
